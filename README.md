# City Builder
## Introduction 

The aim of our project is to create a "City-Builder". This will be a construction game in which the player can choose the location of buildings and the most important such as salaries, taxes and work priorities.

A graphic map of a forest is the starting point, and streets can be added to the city buildings, shops, parks and monuments. Each element of the city will cost a specific amount of money. By adding shops, earned taxes can be used to guarantee be used to guarantee the city's expansion. 
Our game is called "Utopia".

Please see the report for further info.
